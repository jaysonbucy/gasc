This is the codebase for the GASC team website.

To get the client id and secret for the `google_oauth2` you will need to log in to the GASC Google account and go to the developer console. Under the Credentials tab it's "Web Login" key. Click on that and copy the ID and Secret into your `application.yml` file.

There is support for Gravatar based on the user's email. If the user wants to use a different image they can submit the image url to one of the admins and they can add it for them for right now. Functionality for users to add their own url is coming in the future.
